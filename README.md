## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- TailwindCSS
- VueJS

### What I learned

I've never used watch to run a function based on a variable update. This time it was very useful to make card flip every second

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) - With this i managed to create components with ease
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) - VueJS makes it easy to get into dynamic components and SPA
